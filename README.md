## Python Files
In this folder, I've put all of the code I wrote for my ML models and Processing of data.

## Simulation Files
Each Dyna4 project has a set of simulation files.
A .scenario file describes a given scenario. There can be multiple scenario files. The result_data-selection.m file describes what signals to include in the resulting dataset. The signal_aliases.sam file describes a mapping between the signal names in Dyna4, and some more easy to understand names that will be used in the dataset.
